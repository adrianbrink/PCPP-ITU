1.) The tests seem to cover everything, however they should be split up into unit tests.
One test for each function, and them maybe a couple of integration tests to test the
interactions between the methods. In the current state it is shitty to test.

        assert map.remove(9999) == null;
        assert map.remove(117) == null;

        Integer[] keys = {17,34,217};
        String[] values = {"B", "F", "E"};
        map.forEach((k,v) -> {
            assert Arrays.asList(keys).contains(k);
            assert Arrays.asList(values).contains(v);
        });
