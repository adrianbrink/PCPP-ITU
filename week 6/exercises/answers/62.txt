"Why do you not need to write to the stripe size if nothing was added?"
Because if nothing is added the size of the stripe doesn't change

SynchronizedMap is the slowest which is as expected since it locks on the whole map, and in effect runs sequentially.
StripedMap is a lot faster, since it only locks on the stripes and therefor can run in parallel.
StripedWriteMap is even faster since Read operations do not need locks.
WrapConcHashMap is actually a bit slower than StripedWriteMap. This is a bit strange since it uses more clever optimization techniques than StripedWriteMap, and it should therefore run faster.
